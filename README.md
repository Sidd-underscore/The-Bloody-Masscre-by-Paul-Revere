`This is in French`

A manuscript biography of Paul Revere and description of his engraving "The Bloody Massacre", providing context on the situation in mid 1700s Boston

Made for a Social Studies project with a maximum word count of ~225 (hence the low amount of writing)

Uses some cool CSS and HTML tricks, including libraries like JQuery and AOL.

Enjoy!
